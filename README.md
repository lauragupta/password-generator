# password-generator

This is a password generator where the user can select how many characters (from 8-128) they would like to use. The user then is able to choose from 1-4 character sets to include in the password, including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. This generator included use of methods like confirm, alert, and prompt etc...  I created an array of arrays with the character sets and then used a random number generator to loop through characters in my new array to fill it out with the correct number of random characters. Then I took the numbers back out of the array and return them as a single string. I also used a lot of the developer tools to debug as I went, including learning to set break points and step through the code to troubleshoot what the value of variables were as I went through the problem areas.
